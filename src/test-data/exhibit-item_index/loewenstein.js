By 1939, an estimated 80,000 Berlin Jews had managed to emigrate. Between 1941 and 1944 more than 60,000 were deported to Eastern European ghettoes and death camps. Only about 7,000 were known to have survived by 1945.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The historic documents in the Lowenstein Family Papers and Art collection tell the story of one Jewish family&apos;s miraculous survival amidst the horrors of the Holocaust. Two exceedingly rare documents from 1942 served as eviction notices. They order the recipients to report at a certain date and time to a government building in Berlin. In reality the notice was a summons of deportation to death camps. If obeyed, the recipient was killed. If not obeyed, the recipient most certainly did not retain the letter. That notice led to the deaths of an estimated 60,000 Jews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Loewensteins (Lowenstein after immigration) - Max, Maria, Karin, and Henry - lived in Berlin and, beginning in 1933, experienced the ever tightening Nazi noose. Like many other Jewish families they tried desperately to find ways to leave Germany. The beginnings of the Holocaust burst forth on Kristallnacht in 1938. Synagogues were burned and thousands of Jews were taken to concentration camps. Many were never seen again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirteen-year-old Henry was lucky to be one of 10,000 children to be saved by the Kindertransport in 1939. Kindertransports were organized by British aid organizations to bring predominantly German, Austrian, and Czechoslovakian Jewish children to the United Kingdom. Henry was able to reunite with his family in 1947.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henry&apos;s mother Maria, born into a Lutheran family, used her Aryan status to protect her loved ones. Her courage saved the family from deportation and certain death on numerous occasions. She brought the documents in this collection to America in 1946.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henry Lowenstein donated them to the Ira M. and Peryle Hayutin Beck Memorial Archives.

As a young man, Max left his hometown to study medicine at the University of Munich in Germany. Beginning in 1908, he served as a ship&apos;s doctor in the Middle East, Africa, and throughout the Far East. In 1910, he moved to Berlin, Germany to serve as Assistant Doctor at the Berlin-Moabit City hospital and later as a doctor at Berlin&apos;s Charité Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Max submitted his dissertation, &quot;Diagnosis of Children&apos;s Leukemia,&quot; on May 8, 1913 to the Friedrich-Wilhelm University in Berlin and received his medical degree. During World War I, Max served as a doctor for four years with the rank of a commissioned officer. He cared for German troops on the front lines, on both the Eastern and Western fronts in Galicia and France. Max was awarded the Iron Cross First Class for his bravery. In 1919 he settled in Berlin, where he specialized in dermatology and venereal disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was in Berlin that Max met Maria Steinberg (née Bäetge), a widowed artist raising a daughter, Karin, from her first marriage. Max and Maria married in 1925, had a son Henry (Heinrich), and built a life together. The two remained in Berlin throughout World War II, surviving the Holocaust and several attempts to transport Max to Eastern death camps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the War ended, the couple and Karin immigrated to the United States in 1946, making their new home in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. Max died not two years later, on February 3, 1948.&lt;/p&gt;",

As a young woman, Maria studied art in St. Petersburg, Russia, where she met her first husband, Erich Steinberg, an architect. He served in the Russian army as an architect designing buildings on the Sweaborg Island Fortress in Helsinki&apos;s harbor. Maria and Erich were married in 1914, and Maria gave birth to their only child, Karin, in Helsinki, Finland in 1915. In 1917, as the Russian Revolution began, the Steinberg family escaped to Germany. When Erich died in 1920, Maria moved to Berlin where she could support herself and Karin working as an artist and designer. Maria met Dr. Max Loewenstein and they were married in January of 1925. Maria and Max had one child together, a son they named Heinrich, later known as Henry. Maria and her daughter Karin suffered persecution and the dangers of living in a Jewish household during World War II.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the war, the Loewensteins immigrated to the United States. Once in America, Maria (called “Mautzy” by her children) changed the spelling of the family name “Lowenstein,&quot; dropping the first “e” in &quot;Loewenstein&quot; to &quot;make things easier for our American friends,&quot; as she put it. However, she made a point of refusing to change the obviously Jewish last name that had made her the subject of persecution. She said, “I have suffered with this name, and I am proud of it.” She became a well-known artist and teacher in both Pennsylvania and Colorado. She passed away in Denver on October 29, 1982.&lt;/p&gt;",

These early experiences with many of Germany&apos;s leading creators, including composer Kurt Weill, dancers, painters, architects, and writers (many of whom were fortunate enough to leave early on) left a lasting impression on young Henry. As a child, Henry would sing and perform for his parents&apos; guests, but their well-intentioned laughter caused him to shun the stage, preferring in later years to exercise his creativity behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henry was seven years old on January 30, 1933, when Adolph Hitler became Chancellor. Life began to change for Germany&apos;s Jews, the oppression growing with each passing year. In July 1938, Henry celebrated his Bar Mitzvah.

Dr. Max Loewenstein and Henry were issued their cards at Gestapo headquarters on March 31, 1939 in Berlin. For Henry it was a significant moment as he watched his father, who had always been a commanding presence, endure the insults screamed at him by the Gestapo&apos;s bureaucrats. Henry later recalled that this was the moment he truly realized the hopelessness of the family&apos;s situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jews, desperate to leave Germany, Austria, and occupied Czechoslovakia, were only allowed to take a very small amount of money out of the country. Other countries, still struggling to feed their own people at the end of the Great Depression, could not afford to take these penniless refugees. Henry&apos;s cousin, Ingrid Lind, was lucky enough to have Danish citizenship and escaped to Denmark. When the Germans occupied Denmark in 1940, she escaped alone to Sweden and Finland. At age nineteen, she crossed Russia into the Middle East on foot, where she joined the British Army.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Max had previously applied for visas to the United States and investigated other emigration options for the family, but nothing appeared to be possible for at least another three years. Jews were not likely to be able to survive that long under Nazi rule. The family barely survived in Berlin until the end of World War II.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henry was able to escape to England through a British refugee program known as the Kindertransport.&lt;/p&gt;",

        "text": "&lt;p&gt;In early February 1939, Herr Rosenberg, one of the few teachers still at Wilsnacker Strasse Jewish School, asked Henry to stay after class. He told Henry that he knew of a committee that would sponsor one boy for admittance to England. Kristallnacht had prompted a wave of British sympathy for the suffering of the Jews under Nazi rule, and refugee aid groups had successfully persuaded Parliament to admit an unspecified number of Jewish children, if a £50 bond was posted for each child. Between December 1, 1938 and September 1, 1939, a series of trains, ships, and planes brought approximately 10,000 Jewish children into England. The program eventually became known as the Kindertransport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henry&apos;s mother Maria applied immediately, and received a letter a few weeks later announcing Henry&apos;s acceptance into this program. It took several months for the committee to handle all the paperwork with both British and German governments, but on May 29th the Loewensteins received a letter with Henry&apos;s travel date - June 5, 1939. Thirteen year old Henry and his family knew that his move to England would save his life, but it also meant a wrenching separation from his family. Max and Maria hoped that it would not be long before the whole family could leave Germany. However, the war broke out within 12 weeks and the family would be separated for eight years, the only communication coming infrequently through the Red Cross.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henry spent two months in a refugee camp, then briefly attended a school in London, before being evacuated with all of London&apos;s children into the countryside on the eve of war. He ended up in Whipsnade, a beautiful English village, adjacent to a branch of the London Zoo, where he soon found part time work while attending the village&apos;s one room school. Later he worked on a farm and served with the British Home Guard until the end of the war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A plaque, thanking the British Parliament for enabling 10,000 Jewish children to escape to England in 1939, was donated in 1999 by Kindertransport survivors and is prominently mounted adjacent to the entrance of the House of Commons.&lt;/p&gt;",

Nazis also targeted the mentally and physically disabled, gypsies, Soviet prisoners of war, homosexuals, Polish and Soviet citizens, political opponents, religious dissidents, and those whose behavior did not match prescribed Nazi social norms.  Frequent air raids were systematically destroying Berlin. Surviving among the ruins, the Loewensteins did as much as they could to help their friends. Maria welcomed displaced individuals like Monica, the daughter of a deceased Jewish mother and a fanatic Nazi father, into their home. Maria also sent food and packages of necessities to family and friends who had been sent to ghettoes (Max’s brother Georg and sister-in law Alice) and concentration camps (family friends the Eylenburgs).",

When Georg was released in February 1939, his fingers and toes were badly frostbitten, and he was a broken man.

They sent their eldest child, Erna to the France on March 30, 1939 when she was just 15 years old. She later moved to the Netherlands. After the Netherlands fell to Germany, Erna was on one of the first transports to the Auschwitz Concentration Camp and was murdered there in 1942. In 1943, Ernst and Elisabeth were transported to the Theresienstadt Concentration Camp. Their young son Walter (age 13) would be sent there too about six months later.\nKarin and Maria attempted to relieve the Eylenburgs’ suffering by sending packages of food and personal care items. Doctors Ernst and Elisabeth replied with three pre-printed cards of thanks, the only form of communication allowed the prisoners of Theresienstadt. Due to examination by prison guards, each card is postmarked several days or weeks after the date of the card.\nIn August 1944, Dr. Elisabeth found a way to smuggle out an actual message to the Loewensteins. In it, she thanks them for their package and manages to sound positive, reporting that her husband is well and her son has grown almost as tall as his father. That message, dated August 5, was written in response to a package received on July 11, and is postmarked August 31. The final card received from the Eylenburgs, is signed in a weak hand by Elisabeth and dated September 22, 1944. This was the last the Loewensteins heard from them.\nDr. Ernst and Walter Eylenburg were taken to the Auschwitz Death Camp and, according to the Central Database of Shoah Victims' names, murdered soon thereafter. Dr. Elizabeth Eylenburg was taken to Auschwitz a short time later and also killed.",

Maria’s status as an Aryan, as well as her bravery and wisdom, saved Max many times. Most notably she and Karin joined the only successful demonstration of Germans opposing the Nazi’s attempts to take Jews to their deaths, during what later became known as the \"Rosenstrasse Factory Event\". The deportation threat was always there, but when in March 1943, the British began their night time ”1,000 bomber” raids and the U.S. Eighth Air Force followed with massive daylight raids on Berlin, the Nazis were too busy to thoroughly follow-up with the deportations. The Russians battled their way into the ruins of Berlin in the winter and spring of 1945. Finally, Germany surrendered on May 7, 1945. The Loewensteins’ long nightmare of fear and separation was almost over.",
