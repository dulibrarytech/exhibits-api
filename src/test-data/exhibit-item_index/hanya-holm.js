In the 1920s, Holm moved to Dresden to study with the German modern dance pioneer Mary Wigman, quickly becoming one of Wigman's most promising protégées. In the early 1930s, wary of Adolf Hitler's growing influence, Holm accepted dance impresario Sol Hurok's offer to run a Wigman school in the United States.</p><p>Though her school was based in New York, Holm traveled extensively to perform and teach. She first visited Colorado in 1933 when she taught at the Perry Mansfield Dance Camp in Steamboat Springs.</p><p>Holm's connection to the region became an enduring one. She began teaching an eight-week summer course at Colorado College in 1941, returning to the state every summer to teach for 43 years. Holm's yearly summer classes made Colorado a destination for modern dancers, and had an impact on dance and dancers in the state and region for decades.</p>",

Holm, who was unnerved by the rise of Adolf Hitler, eagerly accepted his offer.

        "text": "<p>In the early 1940s, Lillian Covillo (co-founder of Colorado Ballet) had an impulse to try something a little different. A ballet student since the age of nine, Covillo recalled thinking \"if I don’t get out of fifth position, I’m going to scream! I need to move!\”</p><p>This impulse drew Covillo to study modern dance at the University of Denver. There, she met the free-spirited Freidann Parker and a lifelong partnership was born. Parker had studied with Hanya Holm in New York, and, according to Covillo, had modern dance \"in her bones.\" The two decided to put their respective talents together to create, as Covillo put it, a \"more eclectic sort of ballet company that would do modern.\"</p><p>Covillo credited Holm with teaching her and Parker a system of choreography that they used throughout the life of Colorado Ballet. Reflecting on Holm’s influence on choreography, Covillo said: \"I look at things now...and I think, ‘Hanya would collapse if she saw this!’ It has no form, it has no pattern – all the things that are very essential in choreography....Hanya had an absolute pattern.\"</p>",

        "text": "<p>Many of Hanya Holm’s former students and company members settled in Colorado. Several of these went on to both teach and direct at the Children’s Dance Theatre, which was a part of the University of Denver's Lamont School of Music's Dance Department. These students included Freidann Parker, later co-founder of the Colorado Ballet, and Carolyn Durand Brooks, an early company member and longtime friend of Holm.</p><p>Martha Wilcox and Vera Sears, also former students, both taught and served as directors. Sears, who directed the Children’s Dance Theatre for 17 years, called teaching children her \"life’s work,\" and in her oral history, conducted in 2004, said that \"the most important part of [her] life was the Children's Dance Theatre.\"</p><p>The Lamont School of Music was founded in 1924 by noted voice teacher Florence Lamont Hinman, but functioned as a private, proprietary music school until its merger with the University of Denver in 1941. From 1941 through at least 1958, the Children’s Dance Theatre, which was part of Lamont’s Dance Department, operated out of a mansion at 909 Grant Street. Allen Young, music critic for the Denver Post, said about the Children’s Dance Theatre: \"Children and dancers express themselves in distinctive terms, and when youthful dancers turn and leap with natural exuberance...it is a sight hard to resist.\"</p>",
