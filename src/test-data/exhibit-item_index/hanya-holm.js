        "text": "<p>Hanya Holm was born in 1893 as Joanna Eckert in Worms, Germany. In the 1920s, Holm moved to Dresden to study with the German modern dance pioneer Mary Wigman, quickly becoming one of Wigman's most promising protégées. In the early 1930s, wary of Adolf Hitler's growing influence, Holm accepted dance impresario Sol Hurok's offer to run a Wigman school in the United States.</p><p>Though her school was based in New York, Holm traveled extensively to perform and teach. She first visited Colorado in 1933 when she taught at the Perry Mansfield Dance Camp in Steamboat Springs.</p><p>Holm's connection to the region became an enduring one. She began teaching an eight-week summer course at Colorado College in 1941, returning to the state every summer to teach for 43 years. Holm's yearly summer classes made Colorado a destination for modern dancers, and had an impact on dance and dancers in the state and region for decades.</p>",

Holm became Wigman's chief instructor in 1928.</p><p>Sol Hurok, a dance impresario who hoped to promote a Wigman company in America, offered to finance Holm’s move to the United States in 1931. Holm, who was unnerved by the rise of Adolf Hitler, eagerly accepted his offer. She would spend the early 1930s teaching the Wigman technique at her New York-based school, renaming it in 1936 (with Wigman's permission) to the Hanya Holm School of Dance.</p><p>These early years in America would influence Holm's move away from the darker, angst-ridden, European Wigman technique to a freer, more American style of modern dance.</p>",

This visit would prove to be significant - several of the students in that class (most significantly Martha Wilcox) would arrange, three years later, for the Denver debut of Holm's company. Hanya's Colorado compatriots also played an important role in the early success of her summer dance school at Colorado College.</p><p>These early connections were the beginning of lifelong relationship with the West. After 1941, Holm would spend the next forty-three summers teaching, working, and living in Colorado. Her summer dance school made the state a destination for anyone who wanted to learn about modern dance. Her influence on performing arts in the region as an educator, mentor, and friend enabled future generations of dancers, choreographers, and educators to find their own voices and learn to tell their own stories.</p>",

        "text": "<p>Hanya Holm’s career was notable for its constant evolution and her experimentation – the only constant was change. She believed that all choreography should evolve organically out of an understanding of the work itself and from a natural movement base. This point of view enabled her to transition seamlessly between different styles, genres, and mediums.</p><p>Over the course of her career, Holm choreographed for the concert stage, television, Broadway musicals, movies, and opera. She was also notable for being the first to copyright a choreographic work when she submitted the Labanotation score for Kiss Me Kate to the Library of Congress.</p><p>Holm's chameleon-like quality as a choreographer ultimately benefitted the work - however, dance scholar Claudia Gitelman has asserted that Holm's focus on serving the project rather than her \"brand\" has led to a lack of recognition relative to the other \"big four\" modern dance pioneers.</p>",
