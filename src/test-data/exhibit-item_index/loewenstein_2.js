        "text": "Between 1933 and the end of World War II in 1945, the Nazis systematically murdered six million Jews – approximately 2/3 of the 1933 Jewish population of Europe. Nearly all Polish, German, and Austrian Jews who remained in their countries perished. In other occupied countries, about a quarter of the Jewish population survived. Nazis also targeted the mentally and physically disabled, gypsies, Soviet prisoners of war, homosexuals, Polish and Soviet citizens, political opponents, religious dissidents, and those whose behavior did not match prescribed Nazi social norms.  Frequent air raids were systematically destroying Berlin. Surviving among the ruins, the Loewensteins did as much as they could to help their friends. Maria welcomed displaced individuals like Monica, the daughter of a deceased Jewish mother and a fanatic Nazi father, into their home. Maria also sent food and packages of necessities to family and friends who had been sent to ghettoes (Max’s brother Georg and sister-in law Alice) and concentration camps (family friends the Eylenburgs).",

Georg was wearing slippers, night clothes, and a robe when they came for him, yet the Nazis would not permit him to change or take a coat. When Georg was released in February 1939, his fingers and toes were badly frostbitten, and he was a broken man. During the Kristallnacht terror, assuming that the Nazis would not return a second time after taking Georg, the Loewensteins and distant family members hid in Uncle Georg’s apartment for a few weeks.",

This time his wife Alice was taken as well and both were transported to the Łódź Ghetto, the second largest ghetto in German-occupied Poland. Maria was able to mail some food and supplies to them, but communication with those in ghettos and concentration camps was severely limited. Maria received one pre-printed note from Georg and Alice, dated February 16, 1942, thanking her for a package. It would be the last the family heard from them. According to Łódź Ghetto census records compiled by Yad Vashem, Israel's memorial to victims of the Holocaust, Georg Loewenstein perished in the Łódź Ghetto, most likely from starvation. Alice Loewenstein was transported to the Chelmno Death Camp on May 15, 1942 where she was killed.",
