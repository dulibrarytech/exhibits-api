Nearly all Polish, German, and Austrian Jews who remained in their countries perished. In other occupied countries, about a quarter of the Jewish population survived. Nazis also targeted the mentally and physically disabled, gypsies, Soviet prisoners of war, homosexuals, Polish and Soviet citizens, political opponents, religious dissidents, and those whose behavior did not match prescribed Nazi social norms.  Frequent air raids were systematically destroying Berlin. Surviving among the ruins, the Loewensteins did as much as they could to help their friends. Maria welcomed displaced individuals like Monica, the daughter of a deceased Jewish mother and a fanatic Nazi father, into their home. Maria also sent food and packages of necessities to family and friends who had been sent to ghettoes (Max’s brother Georg and sister-in law Alice) and concentration camps (family friends the Eylenburgs).",
