    "description": "&lt;script&gt;badF()&lt;/script&gt;&lt;div style=&apos;color: white&apos;&gt;Since the university was founded in 1864, the DU community has sought inspiration and recreation outside of the classroom. Student organizations, department initiatives, and the recently established John C. Kennedy Mountain Campus provide evidence of a continuous drive toward nature throughout the university’s history. The first Kynewisbok student yearbook, published in 1898, included an ode to the University of Denver. The Ode referred to DU as the “queenly mother” “under the slopes of the mountains... where winter kisses the summer on Evans, or Pike’s Peak, or Gray.” Times changed, but DU’s love for the mountains did not. The 1974 yearbook featured the music and lyrics of John Denver’s well-known song, “Rocky Mountain High.” Several decades later, the Kynewisbok highlighted student recreational clubs as “Rocky Mountain High Outlets to Students,” where “the temptation to explore and the reminder to preserve are constant threats to studying.” Today, DU students share their Rocky Mountain adventures via Instagram, Facebook, and other social media platforms. Student organizations and University programs throughout time have created opportunities for DU students to leave some of their stress behind on campus and journey to the mountains.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style=&apos;font-size: 1.5em; text-align: center&apos;&gt;How we recreate is just as important as why we recreate.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Outdoor organizations have published guidelines for how to recreate responsibly in 2023. These include building an inclusive outdoors, respecting others, and following Leave No Trace principles. By recognizing the historic and systemic exclusivity of outdoor recreation, we can work to create a more inclusive environment for all seeking connection in and with nature. Leaders in the field call for the acknowledgment of historic denver and contemporary discrimination to address the history of segregation in public spaces. Institutionally, another area for change is amplifying diverse perspectives in the field by filling leadership positions with people of color. Responsible outdoor recreation also requires respecting the connections that others may hold to a place. In the United States, some recreation areas occupy stolen land that embodies the cultural heritage of contemporary Native American communities. Certain national parks, state parks, and other recreation areas are both natural and cultural landscapes. When visiting an area to recreate, consider whose land you are on, and how you can respect their connections to the place while you form your own. When recreating, practicing respect for the environment is critical for maintaining the nation’s natural resources for the enjoyment of future generations. Leave No Trace principles are designed to teach low impact ethics to balance recreational land use with preservation. Practicing sustainable recreation is key to the longevity of our natural spaces.&lt;/div&gt",

By 1939, an estimated 80,000 Berlin Jews had managed to emigrate. Between 1941 and 1944 more than 60,000 were deported to Eastern European ghettoes and death camps. Only about 7,000 were known to have survived by 1945.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The historic documents in the Lowenstein Family Papers and Art collection tell the story of one Jewish family&apos;s miraculous survival amidst the horrors of the Holocaust. Two exceedingly rare documents from 1942 served as eviction notices. They order the recipients to report at a certain date and time to a government building in Berlin. In reality the notice was a summons of deportation to death camps. If obeyed, the recipient was killed. If not obeyed, the recipient most certainly did not retain the letter. That notice led to the deaths of an estimated 60,000 Jews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Loewensteins (Lowenstein after immigration) - Max, Maria, Karin, and Henry - lived in Berlin and, beginning in 1933, experienced the ever tightening Nazi noose. Like many other Jewish families they tried desperately to find ways to leave Germany. The beginnings of the Holocaust burst forth on Kristallnacht in 1938. Synagogues were burned and thousands of Jews were taken to concentration camps. Many were never seen again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirteen-year-old Henry was lucky to be one of 10,000 children to be saved by the Kindertransport in 1939. Kindertransports were organized by British aid organizations to bring predominantly German, Austrian, and Czechoslovakian Jewish children to the United Kingdom. Henry was able to reunite with his family in 1947.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henry&apos;s mother Maria, born into a Lutheran family, used her Aryan status to protect her loved ones. Her courage saved the family from deportation and certain death on numerous occasions. She brought the documents in this collection to America in 1946.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henry Lowenstein donated them to the Ira M. and Peryle Hayutin Beck Memorial Archives. The collection is located in the Anderson Academic Commons, Special Collections and Archives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&apos;item-1-blocks&apos; style=&apos;width: 100%; margin-top: 50px; text-align: center; font-size: 19px&apos;&gt;&lt;div style=&apos;margin: 0 auto; width: 85%; display: flex;&apos;&gt;&lt;div style=&apos;background: rgb(165,87,41); padding: 30px; border-radius: 25px; margin-right: 50px;&apos;&gt;More Information available at:&lt;div style=&apos;display: flex; margin-top: 30px; position: relative&apos;&gt;&lt;div style=&apos;width: 50%&apos;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Loewenstein Family Papers and Art Finding aid&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button&gt;finding aid&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&apos;position: relative&apos;&gt;&lt;div&gt;View the Entire Collection&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button style=&apos;position: absolute; bottom: 0px; right: 12px&apos;&gt;collection&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&apos; background: rgb(140, 64, 50); padding: 30px; border-radius: 25px;&apos;&gt;&lt;div style=&apos;height: 20%&apos;&gt;Please complete this feedback form for a 1-minute survey to helps us improve and engage our exhibits with different audiences.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&apos;height: 80%; position: relative; right: 47px;&apos;&gt;&lt;button style=&apos;position: absolute; bottom: 0px;&apos;&gt;survey&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",
